Computer10 will use iterative deepening. It will use ordering only at the first level. It will get the ordering from the last iteration

Computer11 might use ordering at the first two levels from previous iterations. It may be possible to use all levels of previous iterations, maybe with a hash table.

Can processing become faster if r and g are replaced by something more binary?

Make the computer able to play versus itself, repeatedly. That is, a Dom program should ask the user who the players should be, and their time limits and characteristics.

Is it a waste to use e to the power?

Change the static evaluator such that it considers not only relative moves, but also centrality, height of towers, etc. To do this, have Dom strategies evolve against each other.

If the game becomes repetitive or there are no more captures, maybe the computer should adjust its strategy. Maybe try to combine towers to get reserves.
---------------------------------------------------
OK. What do I need to do? I should change the static evaluator because it's the program's greatest weakness.

I need a way to have two programs play against each other so that I can compare them. 

I should try MCTS, which I now sort of understand. See the Google
paper and the Wikipedia page. This will be a more major revision.


And I can try making the static evaluator into a neural network, which will
be an even more major change.
